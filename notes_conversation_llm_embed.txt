# install poetry to handle dependecies conflicts as we are going to mix both requirements.txt from the two different virtualenvs tts_stt and langchain_embedding project to build our app:
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
export PATH="/home/creditizens/.local/bin:$PATH"
poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion
poetry init -n # non interactive
sudo poetry.sh
then put : <virtualenv_path/bin/>poetry add <package_name_without_version_number>
sudo sh poetry.sh
# then install
poetry install # no need normally as poetry add will also install just need to fix issues with dependency by adding specific versions
# then export to requirements.txt file and install using pip -r requirements.txt in your virtual env
llm_chat_embed_venv/bin/poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements_reconcileddd_with_poetry.txt --without-hashes
pip install -r requirements_reconcileddd_with_poetry.txt

## some othe rpotetry commands
